=============
To practise hacking encryption ciphers and to study CAESAR ciphers' implementations.

Acient Breakable Ciphers and Caesar Ciphers

Acient Breakable Ciphers are collected from "A SELF-STUDY COURSE IN BLOCK-CIPHER CRYPTANALYSIS"
Caesar Competition is an next generation authenticated encryption algorithms competition.
Benchmarks are generated by SUPERCOP.
